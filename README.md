# Norwegian-Spell-checker-powered-by-AI

In this project, we will build a spell checker and auto-corrector for Norwegian. 
Inspired by levenshtein distance algorithm, this spell checker is mainly built from scratch.
In the last part of it, we also used AI to choose the right candidate word(s) to replace the misspelled word(s).
More spesific we used a transformer model called NorBert2 which can smartly guess a masked word based on the context around that misspelled word.
Regarding the implementation, we build a  class. THis class has 17 methods. We wrote description for every method. So please read the comments in the code.

OBS. we skip making frequency table because different project have different frequency table. So we just add a test frequency table file.
