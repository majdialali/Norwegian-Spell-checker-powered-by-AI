# Norwegian-Spell-checker-powered-by-AI

In this project, we will build a spell checker and auto-corrector for Norwegian. 
Inspired by levenshtein distance algorithm, this spell checker is mainly built from scratch.
In the last part of it, we also used AI to choose the right candidate word(s) to replace the misspelled word(s).
More spesific we used a transformer model called NorBert2 which can smartly guess a masked word based on the context around that misspelled word.
